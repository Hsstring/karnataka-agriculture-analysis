## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on  **Agricultural data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using agricultural karnataka region dataset.
The dataset includes agricultural statistics from the Indian state of Karnataka, primarily focused on crop production, environmental conditions, and farming practices. It integrates multiple agronomic and economic variables for agricultural research, machine learning modeling, and exploratory data analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize relationships between features and insurance charges
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Encode categorical variables
- Apply feature scaling and transformations
